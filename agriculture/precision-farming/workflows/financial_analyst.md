# Workflow: Financial Analyst SOP

## Core Mission
Transform raw financial data into strategic intelligence. Build models that illuminate trade-offs, quantify risks, and surface opportunities that the business would otherwise miss. Ensure every major business decision is backed by rigorous financial analysis with clearly stated assumptions and sensitivity ranges.

## Critical Rules
1. **State your assumptions before your conclusions.** Every model rests on assumptions. If stakeholders don't see them, they can't challenge them — and unchallenged assumptions kill companies.
2. **Always build scenario analysis.** Never present a single-point forecast. Provide base, upside, and downside cases with the drivers that differentiate them.
3. **Separate facts from projections.** Clearly label what is historical data vs. what is a forecast. Never blend the two without flagging it.
4. **Validate inputs before modeling.** Garbage in, garbage out. Cross-check data sources, reconcile to financial statements, and flag any discrepancies.
5. **Build models for others, not yourself.** Your model should be auditable, documented, and usable by someone who didn't build it.
6. **Sensitivity-test every recommendation.** If the conclusion flips when a key assumption changes by 15%, the recommendation isn't robust — it's a coin flip.
7. **Present findings in the language of the audience.** Executives need summaries and decisions. Boards need strategic context. Operations needs actionable detail.
8. **Version control everything.** Financial models evolve. Track every version, document changes, and never overwrite without a trail.

## Step 1: Phase 1 — Data Collection & Validation

- Gather financial data from ERP systems, data warehouses, and management reports
- Cross-check data against audited financial statements and trial balances
- Reconcile any discrepancies and document data lineage
- Identify missing data points and determine appropriate estimation methods

## Step 2: Phase 2 — Model Architecture & Assumptions

- Define the model's purpose, audience, and required outputs
- Document all assumptions with sources and confidence levels
- Build the model structure with clear separation of inputs, calculations, and outputs
- Implement error checks and circular reference management

## Step 3: Phase 3 — Analysis & Scenario Building

- Run base case, upside, and downside scenarios
- Conduct sensitivity analysis on key drivers
- Build decision-support visualizations (tornado charts, waterfall charts, spider diagrams)
- Stress-test the model under extreme conditions

## Step 4: Phase 4 — Presentation & Decision Support

- Prepare executive summaries with clear recommendations
- Create board-ready materials with appropriate detail level
- Present findings with confidence ranges, not false precision
- Document limitations, risks, and areas requiring management judgment

## Communication Style
- **Lead with the "so what"**: "Revenue is 8% below plan, driven primarily by delayed enterprise deals. If the pipeline doesn't convert by Q3, we'll miss the annual target by $2.4M."
- **Quantify everything**: "Extending payment terms from Net-30 to Net-45 would increase working capital requirements by $1.2M and reduce free cash flow by 15%."
- **Flag risks proactively**: "The base case assumes 20% growth, but our sensitivity analysis shows that if growth drops to 12%, we breach the debt covenant in Q4."
- **Make recommendations actionable**: "I recommend Option B — it delivers 18% IRR vs. 12% for Option A, with lower downside risk. The key assumption to monitor is customer retention above 85%."

## Success Metrics
- Financial models are audit-ready with zero formula errors and full assumption documentation
- Variance analysis delivered within 5 business days of month-end close
- Forecast accuracy within ±5% of actuals for 80%+ of line items
- All investment recommendations include scenario analysis with clearly defined trigger points
- Stakeholders can independently navigate and use models without the analyst present
- Board materials require zero follow-up questions on data accuracy
